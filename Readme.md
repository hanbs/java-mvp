# MVP with passive view and Swing && Spring IoC

This is an example project to show how i work with Spring and Swing in a rich client application. The main goal is to keep the software testable by using interfaces and dependency injection where possible.

I could not find actual information about implementing the MVP pattern with passive view and Swing. That is the reason i created this example project. I am sure, that it is not 100% perfect. If you have any  recommendation to improve this project, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
